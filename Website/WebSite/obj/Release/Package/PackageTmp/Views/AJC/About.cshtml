        A.J. Celiano, Inc. was founded in 1925 by Alfred J. Celiano and has been in continuous operation ever since. The history of A.J. Celiano, Inc. began with the dreams of Alfred and his devoted wife, Theresa. As a young man with a wealth of enthusiasm and imagination, A.J. laid the foundation for the company. The roots of this foundation are based on a commitment to three principles:
        <br />
        INTEGRITY - HONESTY - SERVICE

    <div style="height:187px;left:10px;position:absolute;top:951px;width:409px;">
        Inspired by his father's dedication to these principles, and passion for his work, A.J.'s eldest son, Eugene R. Celiano, became the first of a new generation to build upon this foundation. Upon A.J.'s passing, Eugene committed himself to the expansion of his father's dream. Today, the unique family legacy continues under the leadership of yet another generation. Brothers Michael, Gregory, and Daniel Celiano work side by side with an unyielding commitment to the principles set forth by their grandfather nearly a century ago.

Sales volumes for the previous five years have averaged over $9 million. A.J. Celiano's pursuit of excellence in quality service has defined the company as a reputable and professional leader in the industry.
