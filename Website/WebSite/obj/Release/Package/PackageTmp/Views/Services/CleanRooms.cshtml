                    <p>A.J. Celiano, Inc. is an industry leader when it comes to designing Clean Air and Humidiﬁcation Rooms for medical laboratory environments. We have the engineering knowledge, installation experience, service responsiveness, and most importantly, the trust of customers who expect high efﬁciency, consistent comfort, and the cleanest conditioned air possible. </p>
                    <p>Our most recent experience at U.S. Customs & Border Protection, Newark, NJ, Cellldex Therapeutics, Phillipsburg, NJ, Ruger Chemical, Linden, NJ, and Medical Diagnostics Laboratory of Hamilton, NJ provided us the opportunity to design and install cleanroom facilities for medical and animal laboratory environments. Given the sensitivity of materials assessed and the necessity to limit contaminants, our efﬁcient design and meticulous installation processes and procedures have exceeded our customers expectations. </p>
                    <p>Humidiﬁcation environments have recently become important to lab facilities to maintain high levels of control for testing procedures set forth by governmental agencies and private industries. </p>

                    <h2>Cleanroom Characteristics</h2>
                    <p>Modern "clean" process environments often must be so clean that it is impractical to simply ﬁlter the air. Separate environments called cleanrooms have been developed to keep particle contamination at known, controlled levels. Cleanrooms are designed to maximize laminar ﬂow and minimize particle traps. In the most efﬁcient facilities, ﬁlters are installed in the ceiling and air returns are installed in the ﬂoor. This results in the cleanest environment possible, and minimizes the number of particles that are carried from one place to another by advection.</p>
