            <p>A.J. Celiano, Inc. was founded in 1925 by Alfred J. Celiano and has been in continuous operation ever since. The history of A.J. Celiano, Inc. began with the dreams of Alfred and his devoted wife, Theresa. As a young man with a wealth of enthusiasm and imagination, A.J. laid the foundation for the company. The roots of this foundation are based on a commitment to three principles:<br></p>
            <p class="text-center bold">INTEGRITY - HONESTY - SERVICE</p>
        </div>
    </div>

        <img src="~/Content/Images/AboutUs/Owners.png" class="box-shadow margin-bottom-15 col-md-5 col-xs-12" style="float:right; padding-right:0;" />
        <p>Inspired by his father’s dedication to these principles and passion for his work, A.J.’s son, Eugene R. Celiano, became the first of a new generation to build upon his foundation.  Eugene committed himself to the expansion of his father’s dream.  Today, the unique family legacy continues under the leadership and work of brothers Daniel, Gregory and Michael.  Yet another generation of succession has come when Thomas Celiano joined the company in 2007.  Together, they work collaboratively to continue the unyielding commitment and principles set for nearly a century ago.</p>
